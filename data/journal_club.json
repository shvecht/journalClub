In 2025, it is estimated that 20 890 US women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 12 730 patients will die of ovarian cancer. OBSERVATIONS: Approximately 90% of ovarian cancers are epithelial malignancies, of which 70% to 80% are high-grade serous ovarian cancers. L...",

Venous malformations (VMs) are the most prevalent type of vascular anomalies, representing roughly 70% of all cases. VMs can cause significant pain, impaired mobility, disrupt organ function, and in severe cases, become life-threatening. Intralesional sclerotherapy after tracheotomy is a safe and effective treatment for extensive VMs involving oropharyngeal areas of the head...",

Ankyloglossia has been proposed as a risk factor for SDB, and frenotomy as a treatment for SDB in children with ankyloglossia. With increasing ankyloglossia diagnoses, it is critical to evaluate the evidence for a linkage between SDB and ankyloglossia.

The BC layer is a reservoir of progenitor cells necessary for the formation and regeneration of the epithelium. The epithelium is susceptible to the deposition of inhaled irritants such as cigarette smoke (CS) and electronic cigarette (E-Cig) aerosol. The objective of this study was to quantify BC, proliferating cells, and epithelial histologic architecture in the larynx following a 6-week exposure to CS or E-Cig aerosol. METH...",
