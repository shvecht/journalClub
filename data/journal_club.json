Unlike traditional machine learning, DL autonomously learns hierarchical representations from raw data, offering distinct advantages for analyzing images (eg, stroboscopy) and physiologic signals (eg, cochlear implant optimization). Despite these advances, DL remains conceptually difficult for many clinicians to i...",
