Although the relationship between eosinophils and NP formation has been extensively studied, the mechanisms governing eosinophil transepithelial migration into the nasal mucosa remain poorly understood. Cadherin-26 (CDH26), an epithelial adhesion molecule that binds to integrins α4 (ITGA4) and αE, has been implicated in eosinophil...",
