While richly vascularized, this tissue is particularly vulnerable to ischaemic injury caused by intranasal cocaine use. Cocaine inhibits catecholamine reuptake, leading to vasoconstriction, tissue necrosis, and, ultimately, septal damage. Furthermore, the adulterant levamisole, present in up to 80% of seized cocaine in Germany, is a known trigger for vasculitis, compounding this e..."

However, the indications for salvage surgery remain diverse and poorly standardized, with reported 5-year survival o..."

    "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Surgery involving the skull base has recently gained significant prominence in treatment of head and neck cancer. \"En bloc temporal-parotid resection,\" as applied in primary malignancies of the external ear, should be considered as a shift in the surgical landscape of \"extended total parotidectomies\" to achieve negative surgical margins and decrease the risk of tumor spillage during the procedure. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate survival outcomes and margin status..."
