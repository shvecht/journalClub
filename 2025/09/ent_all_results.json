We report the case of a 13-year-old male with a history of neonatal hypoxia, prolonged intubation, and multiple failed airway surgeries, presenting with a Myer-Cotton grade IV subglottic stenosis. Imaging and endoscopic evaluation revealed complete subglottic obstruction, absence of the anterolateral cricoid arch, and preoperative apparent absence of either vocal folds.

They can be used in patients with meatal atresia and persistent otorrhea. Unlike bone-conduction hearing aid (BCHA), there is no need for pressure between the transducer and the temporal bone. Effective hearing is achieved by simply bringing the cartilage-conduction transducer into contact with the auricular cartilage. Crouzon syndrome is characterized by c..."
