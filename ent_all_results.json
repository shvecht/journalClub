It is currently approved for the treatment of unresectable, locally advanced, or locoregionally recurrent head and neck cancers in Japan. However, data regarding the clinical safety of PIT are currently limited in the literature. Herein, we report the case of a 70-year-old man with nasopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma who developed ..."

METHODS: Eighty-two participants were included in this multicentric study: healthy individuals (n = 28) and patients with OD (n = 54), comprising post-viral OD (PVOD, n = 29), p..."

In Case 1, EJV was used after failure of a prior jejunal flap anastomosed to the internal jugular vein (IJV). CDU on postoperative day (POD) 0 showed thr..."

Investigations using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the early phase from the onset are inevitable to diagnose ILH. However, MRI is not usually performed during the early phases of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Hence, ILH is rarely diagnosed, and the hearing prognosis and vestibular function in patients have been poorly understood. In the present study, we report the detailed course..."

Emergency departments (EDs) have been a focus of screening efforts, as they serve large numbers of at-risk patients who commonly do not access health care elsewhere. However, the optimal approach to HCV screening in ED settings remains unknown.

Approximately 20% of paediatric patients with CRSwNP are associated with systemic genetic disorders, with cystic fibrosis (CF) being the most prevalent (2). CF is characterised by a dysfunctio..."

    "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The stapedial reflex (SR) is widely used to predict prognosis in patients with viral peripheral facial nerve palsy (VPFNP), including Bell's palsy, zoster sine herpete (ZSH), and Ramsay Hunt syndrome (Hunt syndrome). While SR positivity is generally associated with cure, it does not guarantee this outcome in all patients. This study aimed to identify predictors of poor prognosis in SR-positive VPFNP patients, focusing on clinical data obtainable during the early stage of the disease. ..."

    "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: We aim to demonstrate whether facility case volume is associated with (1) perioperative outcomes and (2) overall survival in patients with oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) undergoing transoral robotic surgery (TORS). METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort analysis of adults with OPC who underwent TORS between 2010 and 2017 using the National Cancer Database. Patients were stratified into high, mid, and low-volume facility groups based on facility TORS volume percentiles. Perioperative var..."

We sought to determine if the association between timely PORT and survival varies among clinical and demographic high-risk subgroups. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study using the National Cancer Database 2004-2020, patie..."
